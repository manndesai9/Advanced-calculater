# Advanced Calculator

Welcome to my Advanced Calculator project. This is a calculator I built using Python and Tkinter (a built-in GUI library). It can handle not just basic math but also advanced calculations like trigonometry, logarithms, and constants like π (Pi) and e.

## Features

* Basic Math: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
* Advanced Math: Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Square Root, Logarithm
* Constants: Pi (π) and Euler’s number (e)
* Simple and Clean GUI (Graphical User Interface)
* Error Handling (prevents crashes)

## How It Looks

Imagine a clean, dark-themed calculator with buttons that actually work.

## Why I Built This

I built this project to sharpen my Python skills, especially GUI programming with Tkinter. It’s also a great way to show my interest in both coding and mathematics.

## How to Use It

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Advanced-Calculator.git
   ```
3. Run the Python file:

   ```bash
   python advanced_calculator.py
   ```
4. Use the calculator for basic and advanced calculations.

## How It Works

* Clicking a button updates the display.
* The "=" button calculates the result (even for advanced math).
* The "C" button clears the display.

## What I Learned

* How to create a GUI in Python using Tkinter.
* How to handle user input and make it work as a calculator.
* How to safely use `eval()` for evaluating math expressions.

## Future Improvements

* Make the GUI even more user-friendly (better button design).
* Add more advanced math functions (like factorials, radians).
